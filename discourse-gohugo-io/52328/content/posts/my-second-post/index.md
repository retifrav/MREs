Testing links:

- matches the `content` folder structure: [/posts/my-first-post](/posts/my-first-post)
- matches the custom `permalinks` structure: [/posts/2024/11/07/my-first-post](/posts/2024/11/07/my-first-post)

So both links are rendered with correct `href`, but verification fails to check the second one.
