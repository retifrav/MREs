/* 
APIs that ignore a custom I/O interface:
	- InitializeSdk							(pathToDynamicLibraries must be accessible using normal OS APIs, and init needs to be called before SetIoInterface)
	- REDCL::REDCL							(compiledKernelCacheFolder should be located on local drive for performance reasons)
	- R3DDecoderOptions::setScratchFolder	(path should be located on a local drive for performance reasons)

APIs currently unsupported:
	- SaveRWGLog3G10ToOutputTransform3DLut
	- CreateRWGLog3G10ToOutputTransform3DLut
	- CreateRWGLog3G10ToOutputTransformLuts

APIs with full support:
	- Clip::Clip
	- Clip::LoadFrom
	- Clip::GetDefaultImageProcessingSettings
	- Clip::GetRmdHdrProcessingSettings
	- Clip::GetRmdXmp
	- Clip::CreateOrUpdateRmd
	- Clip::CreateTrimFrom
	- Clip::CreateSnapshotFrom
	- Clip::Load3DLut
	- Load3DLut
	- R3DStream::R3DStream

APIs that just return information and do not use I/O:
	- Clip::RmdSidecarPresent
	- Clip::GetRmdPath
	- Get3DLutPath
	
NOTE: paths passed in to the above APIs are mostly passed through as-is to your overridden IOInterface
      class. The one exception is that the end of the filename can and will get updated to open additional
	  R3D files and sidecar files such as RMD files (ie, *_001.R3D -> *_002.R3D, *.RMD, etc.). Follow
	  these guidelines to make sure this works correctly:
	  
	  1) paths must be valid C-style strings that are terminated with a NULL ('\0') character
	  
	  2) filenames must be separated from the path (if there is one) by at least one standard path separator
	     right in front of the filename (forward '/' or backward '\' slash)
		 
	  3) any other non-NULL characters can be part of the path / string in front of the filename. These do
	     not have to be UTF-8 compliant

	  Example of a valid non-standard C path: "#6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4#/A001_C001_AB0102_001.R3D"
	  
	  For the above example the following open calls could come in to your IOInterfaces instance:
		"#6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4#/A001_C001_AB0102_001.R3D"
		"#6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4#/A001_C001_AB0102_000.R3D"
		"#6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4#/A001_C001_AB0102_002.R3D"
		"#6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4#/A001_C001_AB0102.RMD"
		etc.
